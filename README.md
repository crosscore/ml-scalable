Scalable Machine Learning Model Development Samples

## Sample
1. **Model Selection (`model_selection.py`)**
   Dynamically selects the appropriate model based on the size of the data.
2. **Feature Engineering (`feature_engineering.py`)**
   Efficiently processes large-scale data using the hashing trick.
3. **Model Parallelization and Distribution (`distributed_training.py`)**
   Implements multi-GPU distributed training with TensorFlow.
4. **Model Optimization (`model_optimization.py`)**
   Performs model pruning with PyTorch to achieve lightweight models.

## How to Run
After installing the required libraries, execute each script:
# End of Selection
```bash
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow torch pandas
python model_selection.py
